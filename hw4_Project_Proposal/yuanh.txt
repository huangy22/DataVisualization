Grade: A

Notes:

	Good dataset, and great hypotheses. One thing that would be really
	cool to see is if you could identify parallel trends in separate 
	subfields that eventually get linked together (I'm not sure if its 
	possible with your dataset though).

	Analytics look good. You should look into topic modeling if you aren't
	familiar with it. You might find a lot of advanced tools for reasoning
	about these kinds of relationships between documents that are already
	implemented for Python.

	The visualizations sound good.

	Great layout. You might consider grouping them based on whether they 
	analyze authors, articles, or institutions. Especially with the two
	network visualizations, doing so could make it easier for users to
	understand what they're looking at.
